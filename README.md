# Shell Configuration Files for `bash`, `fish`, and `zsh` 🐚

Welcome to my Shell Configuration Files Repository! 🚀

This repository houses configuration files for three popular Unix-like shells: `bash`, `fish`, and `zsh`, all available under the **MIT license** 📜.

## What Sets Each Shell Apart?

- **bash** 🐢 - The reliable workhorse! In the `bash` configuration file, I've added some nifty aliases and made it more colorful 🌈.

- **zsh** 🚀 - Similar to `bash`, but with the superpower of easy autocompletion and syntax highlighting. Check out the config for neat features and aliases 🎨.

- **fish** 🐟 - A bit different from `bash` and `zsh`, but lightning-fast and comes with syntax highlighting and autocompletion right out of the box! I have added some vibrant color and useful aliases 🌟.

All of these shells are in `vi` mode, and come with a default prompt, but you also have the option to use the fantastic `starship` prompt if you prefer(except of the bash for arch Linux config) ✨.

## Overview 📂

This repository is thoughtfully organized based on both shell and distribution:

🐢 **bash**:
